# Taxi-price-prediction.
Project Overview
This project aims to predict taxi fare prices based on various factors such as distance, time of travel, pickup and drop-off locations, and other relevant features. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) models, this system provides accurate fare estimations, which can be useful for ride-hailing services, pricing optimization, and customer fare estimation.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes historical taxi trip data with the following features:

Pickup Date & Time – Timestamp of the trip start
Drop-off Date & Time – Timestamp of the trip end
Pickup & Drop-off Locations – Latitude and longitude coordinates
Distance – Travel distance in kilometers/miles
Passenger Count – Number of passengers in the trip
Fare Amount – The final taxi fare (target variable)
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Primary language)
Pandas & NumPy (Data processing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
Flask/FastAPI (For model deployment, optional)
🔍 Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Removing outliers (e.g., unrealistic fare amounts, negative distances)
Feature engineering (e.g., extracting time-based features)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding distributions, correlations, and trends
Visualizing fare amounts with respect to distance, time, and locations
Model Training & Evaluation
Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Hyperparameter tuning and model comparison
Deployment (Optional)
Developing an API endpoint using Flask/FastAPI to serve predictions
